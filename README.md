# DNA Computing

We propose an in silico approach for classifying the MNIST dataset, categorizing digits from 1 to 9 into nine distinct labels. We introduce a novel distributed computation method that leverages existing DNA-based seesaw gates. Our model employs six parallel distributed computations, followed by two Winner-Takes-All (WTA) neural networks, which generate two three-bit one-hot encoded outputs for label identification. This approach achieves an accuracy of approximately 72.22% in MNIST digit classification, demonstrating the potential of DNA-based computation for multiple tasks.
